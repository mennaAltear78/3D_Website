# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Since the 3D project was heavy on Vercel and it was difficult to deploy, I decided to upload the video of the project instead. Hereâ€™s the video's and some images

In dark and light mode, it's as if it's day and night. 
The sky and plane are affected by the movement of the island. 
We will start showing how the light changes with the transition between dark and light modes, which is a separate feature from what was mentioned above. Additionally,
a popup message appears when you reach a specific island, inviting you to explore new things.

The contact is a form that interacts with the user.
Once it detects a change in the input, it starts processing, and the change is the movement of the fox,
which moves normally during the change in the field. However, the actual action of running is only performed when the form is submitted.

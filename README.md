In dark and light mode, it's as if it's day and night. 
The sky and plane are affected by the movement of the island. 
We will start showing how the light changes with the transition between dark and light modes, which is a separate feature from what was mentioned above. Additionally,
a popup message appears when you reach a specific island, inviting you to explore new things.

The contact is a form that interacts with the user.
Once it detects a change in the input, it starts processing, and the change is the movement of the fox,
which moves normally during the change in the field. However, the actual action of running is only performed when the form is submitted.
